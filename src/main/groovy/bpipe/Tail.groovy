 * Custom support for tailing the log file.
 * <p>
 * This job used to be done by using the 'tail' command directly,
 * but now that the log files contain more meta data that approach 
 * became impractical, especially since problems with buffering 
 * make it extremely complicated to pipe tail output to other commands.
